# Thesis Abstract

 Cities are becoming increasingly connected to the digital world in pursuit of becoming 'smart' and more efficient. In the field of civil engineering, technological advances have opened up new, alternative approaches not only to assess and monitor the deterioration of civil infrastructures but potentially predict structural failure. While the traditional approaches for structural assessment of civil infrastructure have been resource intensive and somewhat inefficient, new approaches aim to explore the potential of data-based approaches which could lead to better allocation of resources and potentially timely detection of abnormal structural behaviour.
   
Motivated by this, the research presented in this thesis aims to investigate the application of artificial neural networks, specifically the multilayer perceptron (MLP), to characterise the normal correlation pattern between monitored environmental conditions (daily-averaged pavement temperatures), operational loads (daily-aggregated heavy traffic counts) and a strain-based performance indicator, using monitoring outcomes from the Great Belt Bridge in Denmark.

The research herein aims to discuss and evaluate the technologies available to investigate the outlined problem, a brief mathematical introduction to the relevant machine learning algorithms, then follows a methodology to review the business problem, explore and prepare the data, model the data and evaluate the best performing models.

In summary, a random discrete hyperparameter search was completed to identify nine unique models, representing nine strain-gauges. After training, these models were evaluated against a set of performance criteria however, on average, the multilayer perceptron models were unable to reproduce (or improve upon) the performance of the multiple linear regression models developed by Farreras Alcover.
